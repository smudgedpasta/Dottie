***COMMANDS LIST***



_MODERATION_

- purge
Command is to be used by ADMINISTRATORS only. Specify how many messages you want deleted and Dottie will clear them, NOT counting
your message for the command. Input 0 or under and Dottie will return "How am I meant to purge {amount} messages, silly?"

- kick
Speaks for itself, the command kicks people from the server. Type anything after the command on the same message and it will be treated
as the reason to show up in the audit log. Command works either by mentioning the user or simply typing their Discord username.

- ban
Similarly to kick, ban bans a user from the server either by mentioning them or typing their Discord username. There are no time inputs
as of now, but you can specify a reason the same way as kick and the command will delete all recent messages by the user.

- unban
Unban works by typing the user you want to unban by Discord username and discriminator. For example: d.unban Dottie#7157



_GENERAL_

- help
Dottie will send a less detailed command list in an embed with all their aliases.

- ping
This is more a command that I need but I wont restrict it. It simply returns Dottie's ping latency.

- credits
(I might change this to the server join message) but this command essentially just sends an embed crediting the people who've
contributed to the bot. It also supplies a full reference sheet of what Dottie looks like, which was drawn by Just Jay.



_FUN_

- hello (aliases: any variant of "hi" or "hello" will be parsed. For example: d.HeLLo, d.HI)
Dottie will simply say hello back, stating your nickname in the server and waving at you.

- AskDottie (aliases: 8ball, ask. For example: d.ask, d.8ball)
Ask Dottie any question and she will repeat your enquiry and return a random answer.

- ab (aliases: dab)
Sends a dog dabbing gif.

- faker
If you have a role named either "Dottie" or "dottie", she will call you out on a challange.



_VOICE_

- connect (aliases: join, get_your_butt_in_here)
Connects the bot to a voice channel. Note that the only way to get her to join is if you're in the channel already.

- disconnect (aliases: leave, go_naughty_step)
Disconnects the bot from the voice channel it was in. You don't have to be in the channel to perform the command.



_OWNER ONLY_

- load
Enables a previously disabled cog/category.

-unload
Disables a previously enabled cog/category.

- reload
Resfreshes specified cog/category.

- shutdown
Shuts the bot down.
