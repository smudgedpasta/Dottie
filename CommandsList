***COMMANDS LIST***



_MODERATION_

- purge
Command is to be used by ADMINISTRATORS only. Specify how many messages you want deleted and Dottie will clear them, NOT counting
your message for the command. Input 0 or under and Dottie will return "How am I meant to purge {amount} messages, silly?"

- kick
Speaks for itself, the command kicks people from the server. Type anything after the command on the same message and it will be treated
as the reason to show up in the audit log. Command works either by mentioning the user or simply typing their Discord username.

- ban
Similarly to kick, ban bans a user from the server either by mentioning them or typing their Discord username. There are no time inputs
as of now, but you can specify a reason the same way as kick and the command will delete all recent messages by the user.

- unban
Unban works by typing the user you want to unban by Discord username and discriminator. For example: d.unban Dottie#7157



_GENERAL_

- help
Dottie will send a less detailed command list in an embed with all their aliases.

- ping
This is more a command that I need but I wont restrict it. It simply returns Dottie's ping latency towards the message.

- profile (aliases: info, userinfo, stats, userstats)
Views a profile containing various stats about the user. You can use the command without mentioning anyone to view your own, or view other's
by either @ mentioning them, typing out their server nickname or typing out their Discord username.

- avatar (aliases: icon)
Sends the avatar of a user. If used on its own, it returns the author's. If used while typing a server members nickname or @ mentioning
them, it will send theirs.



_FUN_

- hello (aliases: "hemlo", "henlo", "hoi", or any variant of "hi" or "hello" will be parsed. For example: d.HeLLo, d.HI)
Dottie will simply say hello back, stating your nickname in the server and waving at you.

- AskDottie (aliases: 8ball, ask. For example: d.ask, d.8ball)
Ask Dottie any question and she will repeat your enquiry and return a random answer.

- ab (aliases: dab)
Sends a dog dabbing gif.

- faker
If you have a role, username or nickname which is spelt under any variant of "dottie", she will challengingly call you out.

- photo
Pulls a random embedded image of Dottie, with a caption and a credit to the artist.

- nsfw_photo (18+ WARNING)
Pulls a random image of Dottie from a pool of graphic images, along with a caption and credts to the artist.

- numberguess (aliases: quiz)
Dottie will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 100, and hint at you if you're two low or high until you get it right. You have 10 chances.

- speak (aliases: say)
Dottie will repeat whatever is said by the user issuing the command. She will also delete that parent message issuing the command. Logging bots
will still pick up on this, however. Note that images cannot be sent through the command, but URL's can.

- pyramid
Dottie will ask you how tall her pyramid will be, and stack orange blocks accordingly. You can supply her any number ranging from 1-25, and will
refuse anything higher or lower.

- rate
Dottie will take your input (from a sentence to a mentioned user) and give it a random, fixed rating.



_VOICE_

- connect (aliases: join, get_your_butt_in_here)
Connects the bot to a voice channel. Note that the only way to get her to join is if you're in the channel already.

- disconnect (aliases: leave, go_naughty_step)
Disconnects the bot from the voice channel it was in. You don't have to be in the channel to perform the command.

- despacito
Headphone warning, this plays a bass boosted version of Despacito. Note that it may cut out randomly as an issue with ffmpeg.



_OWNER ONLY_

- load
Enables a previously disabled cog/category.

-unload
Disables a previously enabled cog/category.

- reload
