# Dottie

Dottie is a Discord bot I make for purely experimental and practise purposes.

# Credits

[Thomas Xin](https://github.com/thomas-xin) for writing code for some higher-level features, hosting the bot and helping with debugging.

(honestly, Dottie is more of a collaboration between us)

[JÃ³zsef Sallai](https://github.com/jozsefsallai) for lending suggestions and helping with debugging.
