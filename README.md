# Dottie

Dottie is a Discord bot I make for purely experimental and practise purposes.

In my journey I have learnt that if you do any programming, lemme' tell you that OneDrive fucks you over. TL;DR: Microsoft sucks :)

[Thomas Xin](https://github.com/thomas-xin) for writing code for some higher-level features, hosting the bot and helping with debugging.

(honestly, Dottie is more of a collaboration between us)
